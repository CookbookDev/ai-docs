# Setting up CloudFlare as a Proxy (Orange Cloud)

First, ensure your domain is on CloudFlare and the "Proxy Status" is set to "Proxied" in your DNS Records.

![CloudFlare DNS settings](https://gist.github.com/assets/20116062/fa5286d1-1649-4cc6-83f5-b2f542aeae3f)

The cloud icon should be **orange**.

<Info>
If you need help adding a custom domain to GitBook, refer to the [GitBook DNS configuration guide](https://docs.gitbook.com/published-documentation/custom-domain/configure-dns#configure-a-cname-record). Note that GitBook recommends not using CloudFlare as a proxy, but it's required for our integration.
