## Implementation example

For most websites, the basic integration is the fastest way to get started:

<CodeGroup>
```html
<!-- Add to your <head> -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@cookbookdev/docsbot/dist/standalone/index.cjs.js" defer></script>
```

```html
<!-- Add to your <body> -->
<div id="__cookbook" data-api-key="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"></div>
```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
Remember to replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key.
